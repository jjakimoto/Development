    "* Blog post: http://learningspot.altervista.org/cryptographic-hash-functions/\n",
    "* Properties:\n",
    "    * Collision-free: almost impossible to find two different values x and y, and $H(x) = H(y)$\n",
    "    * Pre-image resistance: Difficult to guess x from $H(x)$\n",
    "    * Second pre-image resistance: Given output y, it's difficult to find another element $\\hat{x}$ that hashes to y\n",
    "* Note that collision-free implies second pre-image resistance\n",
    "* Applications:\n",
    "    * Message digest (collision-free): Check the hashed values to see identification\n",
    "    * Commit (pre-image resistance): Generate encrypted message, and then send a key to verify what is in the message later\n",

    "## Lamport One-Time Signature Scheme\n",
    "* Let H be a function and consider message $M \\in (0, 1)^k$\n",
    "* Private key: Generate $2k$ random numbers $X_{ij}$, where $1 \\leq i \\leq k$ and $j \\in (0, 1)$\n",
    "* Public key: $Y_{ij} = H(X_{ij})$\n",
    "* Signature: $sig = (sig_1||sig_2||\\dots||sig_k)$, where $sig_i = X_{i0}$ if $M_i = 0$ and $sig_i = X_{i1}$ if $M_i = 1$ \n",
    "* Receiver can verify the signature by seeing if public key and hashed values of signature are matched up\n",
    "* If $M_i = 0$ then $H(sig_i)$ must be $H(sig_i) = Y_{i0}$ otherwise $H(sig_i)$ must be\n",

    "* $N = 2^n$ public keys $X_i$ and private keys $Y_i$\n",
    "* Let $a_{i j}$ be a node of a tree, i denotes the level, which describes the distance from the child, e.g., a_{n 0} is the root of the tree\n",
    "* $a_{0 i} = H(Y_i)$\n",
    "* Each node is hash value of concatenation of its children, e.g., $a_{1 0} = H(a_{0 0} || a_{0 1})$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Signature Generation\n",
    "* Sign the message with one-time signature scheme by using one of the private and public key pairs $(X_i, Y_i)$\n",
    "* Path: $A_0, A_1, \\dots, A_n$ with $A_0 = a_{0 i} = H(Y_i)$ and $a_{n 0} = pub$\n",
    "* $A_{i + 1} = H(A_i || auth_i)$, we need brother $auth_i$ to compute each path\n",
    "* signature is concatenation of auth nodes plus one time signature, $\\hat{sig}$: $sig = (\\hat{sig}||auth_0||auth_1||...||auth_{n−1})$\n",
